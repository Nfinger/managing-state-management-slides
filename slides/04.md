# Server Cache vs UI State

[My State Management Mistake](https://epicreact.dev/my-state-management-mistake)

These two are not the same thing...

1. **Server Cache** - State that's actually stored on the server and we store in
   the client for quick-access (like user data).
2. **UI State** - State that's only useful in the UI for controlling the
   interactive parts of our app (like modal isOpen state).

Use React for UI state.

Use [`react-query`](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) for your server cache.
